The Infections and Cancer Laboratory (INCALAB) develops and implements new molecular tools to improve prevention and treatment of oncological diseases associated with viral infections, particularly to human papillomavirus (HPV).

INCALAB conducts basic research to generate new knowledge on the natural history and progression of HPV infection, as well as pre-clinical studies to identify new molecular markers to increase the accuracy of current routine screening and diagnostic tools. INCALAB also collaborates with in vitro diagnostic (IVD) companies to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of newly marketed diagnostic tests.

We are developing a new project in the INCALAB group related to the papillomavirus genome and how their mutations are related to cancer progression. Therefore, we are working on developing new programs to manipulate huge datasets of HPV genomes,  to finally obtain information that may help us to identify new biomarkers.
